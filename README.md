# interactiveClicks
interactiveClicks is a simple HTML and JavaScript project that simulates a basic cart system. It allows users to add items to a cart and view or reset the total quantity using interactive buttons.

Features
Display the current cart quantity

Add 1, 2, or 3 items to the cart

Reset the cart to zero

Written in plain HTML and JavaScript

Files
index.html – Main HTML file containing both structure and logic

How It Works
The script initializes a cartQuantity variable with a value of 0. Each button on the page triggers a JavaScript function that updates this variable and logs the result in the browser console:

Show Quantity – Displays the current quantity in the console

Add to Cart – Increases quantity by 1

+2 / +3 – Increases quantity by 2 or 3 respectively

Reset Cart – Resets quantity to 0
